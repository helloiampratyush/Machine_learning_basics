## supervised learning vs unsupervised learning

* supervised learning : In a **supervised learning**  task, the data sample would contain a target attribute 
𝑦
**y**, also known as ground truth
* unsupervised Learning : In contrary to the **supervised learning** task, we do not have the ground truth in an unsupervised learning task. One is expected to learn the underlying patterns or rules from the data, without having the **predefined ground truth** as the benchmark.

## Here are a few examples of the unsupervised learning tasks:

* **Clustering** : given a data set, one can cluster the samples into groups, based on the similarities among the **samples** within the data set.
  
* **Association** : given a data set, the **association task** is to uncover the hidden association patterns among the attributes of a sample.

## semi supervised learning 

* In a scenario where the data set is massive but the labeled sample are few, one might find the application of both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. We can call this task as semi-supervised learning.
